# Sudoku Solver Implementation with Algorithm X

##Overview##
This repository contains Rust implementations of a Sudoku solver using Algorithm X (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X),the backtracking algorithm introduced by Donald Knuth to solve an exact cover problem for multiple solutions, both in sequential and parallel versions to explore performance improvements in solving NP-complete problems.

**Features**
- Finds all possible solutions for 9x9 Sudoku puzzle
- Converts Sudoku into exact cover problem
- Two versions of Algorithm X for exact cover problems:
  - Sequential version
  - Parallel version
- Includes benchmark tests to compare sequential vs parallel performance
- Test case for both algorithm x
